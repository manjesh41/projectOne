'''You live 4 miles from university. The bus drives at 25mph but spends 2 minutes at each of the 10 stops on the way. How long will the bus journey take?
Alternatively, you could run to university.
You jog the first mile at 7mph; then run the next two at15mph;before jogging the last at 7mph again. Will this be quicker or slower than the bus?
